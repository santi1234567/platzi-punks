# platzi-punks

### Description:

This project is from a Platzi course. The purpose of the course is to learn how to create a pseudo-random NFT contract and develop a frontend to interact with it.

This repository corresponds to the first part of the course where we learnt how to use the hardhat environment for deploying contracts.
